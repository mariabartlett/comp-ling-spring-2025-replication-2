# Introduction

## Background {.smaller}

**Motivating idea:**

Embeddings offer a compelling empirical technique to capture word _**context**_. Measures of context can help answer questions like:

  - How has the meaning of a word changed through time?
  
  - How do different groups use the same word differently?

**Motivating issues:**

  1. Training embeddings is computationally expensive & words/phrases of interest for researchers often are highly specific and may not have much data on which to train embeddings 
  
  2. Current embedding techniques generally do not provide an inference mechanism (i.e., hypothesis testing)
  
## Authors' Contributions {.smaller}

**Propose a framework that:**

  - 1. Utilizes the à la carte method to efficiently produce context-specific embeddings
  
  - 2. Facilitates inferences about differences in embeddings across covariate values
  
**Illustrate via three use cases for framework:**

  - 1. Do U.S. Democrats and Republicans attach different meanings to the same words?
  
  - 2. Did the word "empire" take on different meanings in the United States vs. United Kingdom after World War II?
  
  - 3. How did Parliament backbenchers feel about Brexit?

# Methods

## Framework structure {.smaller}

1. Choose focal word(s) of interest from corpus

2. Choose covariates of interest

3. Use à la carte embeddings to estimate context-specific embeddings for focal word(s). This requires:

  - Choosing a context window (e.g., 6)

  - Pretrained embeddings (e.g., GloVe)

    - **Why?** Computationally efficient because we don't have to train our own!

  - Transformation matrix ($\hat{A}$)

    - **Why?** Accounts for highly common words with little meaning
   
4. Regress context-specific embeddings on covariate(s) of interest 

5. Norm returned $\hat{\beta}$ matrix for covariate(s) of interest

6. Utilize bootstrapping and permutation testing to calculate _p_-values for inference

## Framework walk-through

Research question: Was the word “Trump” used differently post-2016 U.S. election relative to the word “Clinton”?

# Results

## Use case 1 {.smaller}

**Question:** Do U.S. Democrats and Republicans attach different meanings to the same words?

**Regression:** $Focal\_word\_embedding = \beta_0 + \beta_1Republican + \beta_2Male + \epsilon$

  - Focal words: abortion, immigration, marriage
  
```{r fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root,"03_Replication","_plots","case1.png"))

```

## Use case 2 {.smaller}

**Question:** Did the word “empire” take on different meanings in the United States vs. United Kingdom after World War II?

**Regression:** $Empire\_word\_embedding = \beta_0 + \beta_1CongressionalRecords + \epsilon$

```{r fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root,"03_Replication","_plots","02_beta_plot.png"))

```

## Use case 2 (cont.) {.smaller}

### Nearest neighbors pre-1949:

```{r fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root,"03_Replication","_plots","02_pre1949_nearest_neighbors_plot.png"))

```

## Use case 2 (cont.) {.smaller}

### Nearest neighbors post-1949:

```{r fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root,"03_Replication","_plots","02_post1949_nearest_neighbors_plot.png"))

```

# Autopsy/Differences 

## Autopsy/Differences {.smaller}

**Findings**: All results replicated (ran only a subset of analyses)

**Code:**

- Outdated functions:

  - `geom_vline()` and `geom_hline()`: use `size` argument when `linewidth` should have been used
  
  - `conText()` `transform_matrix`: Jackknife and bootstrap both used when only one possible
  
- Code organization/repetition:

  - Authors' separated code into shorter R scripts
  
    - Manageable chunks made interpretation easier
    
    - However, resulted in lots of repetition across scripts
  
  - When combining, we edited to ensure conciseness and eliminate repetition
  
## Autopsy/Differences (cont.) {.smaller}

**Code:**

- Inconsistent naming: 

  - Naming was sometimes inconsistent across authors' scripts 
  
  - The same name was used for different dataframes
  
- Large file sizes resulted in longer run times

# Extension

## Extension: Validation {.smaller}

- End of paper mentions methods to validate, but does not actually perform any validation

**Validation via convergent construct (use case 2)**

- Investigated validation methods cited from Quinn et al, 2010 paper

- Determined that "convergent construct" validation would make the most sense 

```{r fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root,"03_Replication","_plots","02a_extension_image_01.png"))

```

## Extension: Sensitivity testing {.smaller}

- The `conText()` regression has a variety of parameters; interested in how sensitive results were to different researcher parameter choices

- In Trump vs. Clinton example, re-ran with `hard_cut` = TRUE in order to require that all articles in analysis had a context window of 6 on either side (i.e., precludes target word from being first word)

- This choice significantly cut down sample size but findings were robust

```{r fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root,"03_Replication","_plots","sensitivity_test.png"))

```

## Extension: Future steps {.smaller}

- Utilize other validation methods listed (semantic, predictive)

- Further examine sensitivity of results to researcher decisions (context window, preprocessing, etc.)

- Examine US vs. other countries usage of a word more currently relevant than “empire”
